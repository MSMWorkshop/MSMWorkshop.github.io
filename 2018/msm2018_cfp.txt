We aim to attract researchers from all over the world working on applying Machine Learning and AI models for social media data analytics and predictive insights. Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn have paved the way for generating huge amount of diverse, streaming bit data in a short period of time. Such social media data require the application of big data analytics to produce meaningful information to both information consumers and data generators. Machine learning and AI techniques are particularly effective in situations where deep and predictive insights need to be uncovered from such social media data sets that are large, diverse and fast changing. Following the discussion at our workshop at WWW2017, we aim to focus on how to apply machine learning and AI models, algorithms and systems for analytics and predictive modeling on social media and the web. Contrary to last year’s workshop, we would like to particularly invite researchers that are interested in going beyond standard analytics approaches and try to discover the intelligent information hidden in the large and fast-changing social media data.In this context, we would also like to invite researchers in the machine learning, AI, natural language processing, data and web mining community to lend their expertise to help to increase our understanding of the web and social media. Overall, we are interested in receiving papers related to the following topics which include but are not limited to: 
* learning analytics methods or frameworks for social media, big data and the web 
* AI, machine learning and NLP techniques for social media, big data and the web
* deep learning approaches and models for social media, big data and the web
* approaches for social influence learning
* learning methods for social link prediction
* methods for learning social activities and behavioral analytic metrics
* machine learning and AI models, algorithms and systems
* evaluation of machine learning and AI frameworks and metrics
* applications of machine learning and AI
* applications of any of the above methods and technologies


The goal of this workshop is to apply machine learning and AI approaches and algorithms on social media, big data and the web.

Submissions: We solicit full research papers (4-8 pages), and short
papers (1-4 pages) both in the ACM conference paper style. 
Papers should be submitted in EasyChair to

Proceedings:
============
Contributions will be included in the Companion volume of TheWebConf 2018
conference, which will be published by ACM and included
in the ACM Digital Library. However, to make that happen at least one author of the accepted paper has to register. At the time of submission of the final
camera-ready copy, authors will have to indicate the already
registered person for that publication.

Any paper published by the ACM, IEEE, etc. which can be properly
cited constitutes research which must be considered in judging the
novelty of a TheWebConf submission, whether the published paper was in a
conference, journal, or workshop. Therefore, any paper previously
published as part of a WWW or TheWebConf workshop must be referenced and suitably
extended with new content to qualify as a new submission to the
Research Track at TheWebConf conference.

Submission guidelines:
======================
All submitted papers must
    * be written in English;
    * contain author names, affiliations, and email addresses;
    * be formatted according to the ACM SIG Proceedings template
	(http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates)
	with a font size no smaller than 9pt;
    * be in PDF (make sure that the PDF can be viewed on any
	platform), and formatted for US Letter size;
    * occupy no more than six pages, including the abstract,
	references, and appendices.

It is the authors’ responsibility to ensure that their submissions
adhere strictly to the required format.
Submissions that do not comply with the above guidelines may be
rejected without review.

All submissions must be entered into the reviewing system:
